# ProjectPulse

Before ending every conversation, update a file called `projectpulse.md` in the project root with a brief, up-to-date summary of this workspace. This file is read by the ProjectPulse dashboard to give the user a quick overview across all their projects.

The file should contain:
- **Status**: One line summary of current project state (e.g., "Building REST API, auth module complete")
- **Last worked on**: What was done in this session
- **Next steps**: 1-3 bullet points of what needs to happen next
- **Blockers**: Any issues or dependencies blocking progress (or "None")
- **Key files**: The 3-5 most important files someone picking this up should look at

Keep it concise — this is a quick-glance summary, not documentation. Overwrite the previous content each time (don't append).
